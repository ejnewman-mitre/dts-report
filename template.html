<p>Hi {{fname}},</p>
<p>
This is just a friendly reminder that the current DTS Compliance Report shows that you
have one or more devices that are overdue for upgrades or that need patches.
</p>
<p>
Here's where the T881 group stands at the moment:
</p>

<table class="reportTable">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<th colspan="4" scope="column">
				T881 Agile Sys Design &amp; Engineering Summary Report
			</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Compliant Machines</td>
			<td class="cent">{{compliantCount}}</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Non-Compliant Machines</td>
			<td class="noncomp cent">{{nonCompliantCount}}</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Machines Not Reporting</td>
			<td class="cent">{{notReportingCount}}</td>
		</tr><tr>
		</tr><tr>
			<td class="tots">Total Machines</td>
			<td class="tots cent">{{totalMachines}}</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>
<p>
Please install the recommended patches and run the "Inventory Now" function inside of
the Mitre Self-Service app to update your compliance status.
</p>
<p>
The following devices need attention:
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<table  class="padded-table">
<tr><th>Device</th><th>ID</th><th>Problem Reported</th></th>
{{#each machine}}
<tr><td>{{{this}}}</td></tr>
{{/each}}
</table>
</p>
You can get more information about these issues, and links for updates at FJ: <a href="http://dts.mitre.org/dts/orgReport.aspx?txtDept=T881">DTS</a>
</p>
Thank you!
<p>
Please perform any needed updates and overdue patches to bring your equipment back into security compliance.
<p/>
<p/>
<i>We donâ€™t want to show up as non-compliant on these Monday reports that go to senior
leaders for advanced attention.</i>

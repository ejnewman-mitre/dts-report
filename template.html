Hello everybody,

This is just a friendly reminder that the current DTS Compliance Report shows that your computer is overdue on patches.
Please install the recommended patches and run the Inventory Now application to update your compliance status.

Thank you!

Please Update your overdue patches to bring your equipment back into security compliance.
We donâ€™t want to show up as non-compliant on these Monday reports that go to Senior leaders for advanced attention.

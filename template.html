Hi {{fname}},

This is just a friendly reminder that the current DTS Compliance Report shows that you
have one or more devices that are overdue for upgrades or patches.

Please install the recommended patches and run the "Inventory Now" function inside of
the Mitre Self-Service app to update your compliance status.


The following devices need attention:


{{#each machine}}
• {{this}}
{{/each}}

Thank you!

Please Update your overdue patches to bring your equipment back into security compliance.

We don’t want to show up as non-compliant on these Monday reports that go to senior
leaders for advanced attention.
